                We briefly mentioned IP addresses earlier, but what exactly is an IP address made of? For starters, it is a collection of numbers that is unique to any device on a network. IP addresses come in parts, just like a street address. The parts consist of the country/network, the region/network, the subnetwork, and the device itself. This format is called IPv4 and each of the parts is represented by a portion of numbers. Each part is made up of 8 bits, totalling 32 bits for the entire address. Computers need to use IP addresses in order to send data between one another. Similarly to sending a letter in the mail, a computer will reach out to another computer by sending data and leaving behind its original address so that the receiving computer knows where to send data back.

            <p>
                Sending data on the internet is a little different to how we might send a letter in the real world. Perhaps if the data were very small, a computer could send that piece of data to another and it would not be an issue, but typically this is not the case. When sending data on the internet, the data being sent is split up into many separate parts known as packets. The data is divided up and sent on a path to its destination. The path that these packets take does not have to be the same as the others and they might not all arrive at the exact same time either. But when all the packets finally do arrive, they are combined to create the original piece of data that was sent. Routers are used to choose the best path to send data on and make sure nothing goes wrong along the way. While TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, makes sure that once the packets arrive at their destination, that nothing is missing and you can be certain that the data you received is correct. If there is an error, a request will be made to send the data again until it all arrives perfectly.
