            <h1>HTTP and HTTPS Protocols</h1>
            <p>
                HTTP and HTTPS are two of the major internet protocols that exist today. A protocol is just a set of rules that we use. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, and it basically is a set of rules for how to communicate on the internet. This doesn't mean that users have defined rules in how they can communicate on the internet, but instead how data transmitted over a network communicates with other computers and networks. In HTTP, users can send text and the computer will convert that into binary zeros and ones. When the data is received, it is immediately interpreted and translated back into its original text. You can even transfer other types of data such as images or sound. Think of HTTP as an interpreter that translates from text to binary and then back to text again. Using HTTP, it allows computers to communicate to each other and the people using the computers to communicate with each other as well. Since computers do not understand language that people use, it is important that data is translated into what computers do understand, to ensure proper transfer of data from one person to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second protocol that exists is HTTPS, which is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the more secure version of HTTP. Any data that is sent using HTTPS is going to be more secure and less prone to being seen by someone who you don't want to see it. For example, if you connect to a public network using HTTP and log into a bank account, hackers can find their way to your credentials because HTTP is not secure enough to hide your data. HTTPS encrypts data that is sent, preventing anyone from trying to see or steal your information without you knowing. So HTTPS is required for websites where personal and private information can be transferred without hackers managing to find it. This protects the user and makes sure that your information is only used in the exact place that you try to use it, and nowhere else.
